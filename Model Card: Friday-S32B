Training Details

- Base Model: Proprietary 32-billion-parameter transformer (architecture details confidential).  
- Fine-Tuning Data:  
  - Size: 800M+ tokens.  
  - Sources: Curated from real-world dialogues, Hinglish social media, financial reports, and JEE/MIT academic datasets.  
  - Preprocessing: BPE tokenization, removal of sensitive information, normalization of text, and handling of multilingual context switches.  
- Training Process:  
  - Fully pre-trained (unlike v1.0â€™s experimental setup), followed by fine-tuning using the AI Data Powerhouse Engine.  
  - Methods: Supervised learning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to enhance emotional intelligence, conversational coherence, and domain-specific accuracy.  
  - Training Objective: Minimize perplexity (<20) on conversational tasks, optimize accuracy for sentiment classification (92%), sarcasm detection (88%), and Hinglish translation (0.45 BLEU).  
- Compute Resources:  
  - Hardware: 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs (40GB) for parallel processing; 4 TPU v4 Pods for fast inference.  
  - Training Duration: Approximately 4 weeks (pre-training and fine-tuning).  
  - Rationale: NVIDIA A100 GPUs provide efficient training for large transformer models, while TPU v4 Pods optimize inference speed for real-time applications.  

Pre-Training vs. Fine-Tuning:  
- v1.0: Limited pre-training and minimal fine-tuning, resulting in inconsistent performance across tasks.  
- v2.0: Fully pre-trained and extensively fine-tuned, ensuring robust performance and scalability.
